# RadarEmulator: Navico 
This code should emulate a Navico BR24 radar well enough to make the [OpenCPN Radar plugin](https://github.com/opencpn-radar-pi/radar_pi/) happy.
No attempt has been made to extensively emulate all behaviors of the radar - only enough to send an image to OpenCPN.
It's highly experimental, and currently something's wrong with how it encodes the image.
